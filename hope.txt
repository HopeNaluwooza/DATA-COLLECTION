          \textbf{NALUWOOZA HOPE 214007688 14/U/11759/EVE}
              

\section{\textbf{Introduction}}
The data collection was about discovering the challenges bill deliverers face when distributing the bills, and how best these challenges can be solved.
\subsection{\textbf{what the form is about}}
The form basically included the details the person I was interviewing, the area in which he /she works. The problems the deliverers face and what they believe are the possible solutions to the challenges they face.


\subsubsection{\textbf{Aims/ objectives}}
\begin{itemize}
      \item To find out the challenges bill deliverers face when distributing bills.
      \item To get solutions to the challenges bill deliverers face.
      \item To find out why bills are not effectively delivered to the customers.
      \item To increase on umeme revenue.
     
  \end{itemize} 

\subsection{\textbf{problems faced when collecting data}}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Some respondents were not willing to cooperate.
      \item The rain hindered me from reaching certain areas to interview the bill deliverers therefore my interviews were limited to specific places.
      \item Few of the bill deliverers were not understanding the language in which I was interviewing them
      \item some responds were not welcoming and were not willing to cooperate with the interview.

  \end{itemize} 

\section{\textbf{Research methodology  }}
When collecting data I used odk collect and aggregate server to create a form which I used to interview the bill deliverers.

 \subsection{\textbf{Recommendations  }}
The bill deliverers should be provided with enough and effective transport means such as motorcycles such that they can access remote areas were they can’t reach on foot.
